### Game Description

In the game Bellicose Balls, an increasing number of aggressive balls relentlessly roll towards you while hurling insults. </br>
This is a First Person Shooter style game in which the main objective is to avoid the incoming enemies for as long as possible. </br>
If you come in contact with a ball, it will explode and deal damage to you. </br>
You can throw cubes at the balls to prematurely detonate them in desperate situations. </br>
Your score is the length of time you survive.

#### Biggest Development Challenge in Unreal
The biggest challenge was understanding the practical differences between actors, pawns, and geometry. While I understood them theoretically, I often found myself trying to use the Player Character Pawn in place of The Player Character, or performing functions on a Pawn's geometry as opposed to the actor itself which caused numerous issues. </br>
Getting Locational audio was a bit challenging too, with having to figure out sound attenuation and concurrency, but it was extremely rewarding when I completed those sections.


#### The most interesting part of the game
The most interesting part of the game is its deceptively high difficulty, along with the satisfaction of watching dozens of physics objects interacting with the player and the terrain.
